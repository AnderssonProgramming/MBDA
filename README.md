## üåü Overview

In this course, you'll dive into the essential world of databases and learn how to:
- **Understand Basic Concepts & Data Models:**  
  Explore the building blocks for modeling data and creating robust data solutions.
- **Master the Relational Model:**  
  Learn about structure, integrity (both declarative and procedural), relational algebra, and SQL.
- **Explore Advanced Database Topics:**  
  Delve into extended data models, normalization, transactions, security, and the use of XML for advanced querying.

All materials here are crafted to build a strong theoretical foundation and provide plenty of hands-on practice!
